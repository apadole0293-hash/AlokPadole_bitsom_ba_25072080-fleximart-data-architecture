## 2. Normalization Explanation (3NF)

The database schema follows Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.

- All tables have a primary key that uniquely identifies each record.
- Non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
- There are no transitive dependencies; descriptive attributes are stored only in their respective tables.

For example:
- Customer details are stored only in the customers table and not repeated in orders.
- Product pricing and category information are stored only in the products table.
- Order and order item data are separated to avoid repeating order-level information for each product.

This design prevents update, insert, and delete anomalies while ensuring efficient storage and maintenance.
