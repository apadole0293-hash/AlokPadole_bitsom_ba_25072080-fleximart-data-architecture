# MongoDB Schema Design and Analysis

## Overview
This document describes the MongoDB schema design for the FlexiMart retail platform. MongoDB is used to model customer, product, and order data in a flexible and scalable manner.

## Data Modeling Strategy
A hybrid data modeling approach is adopted:
- Customers and products are stored in separate collections.
- Orders embed order items within the same document.

This design minimizes joins and improves performance for order-related queries.

## Customers Collection

```json
{
  "_id": "C001",
  "first_name": "Rahul",
  "last_name": "Sharma",
  "email": "rahul.sharma@gmail.com",
  "phone": "+91-9876543210",
  "city": "Bangalore",
  "registration_date": "2023-01-15"
}

## Part 2.1: NoSQL Justification Report

### A. Limitations of Relational Databases for FlexiMart

Relational databases are well suited for structured transactional workloads, but they present several limitations when handling large-scale, evolving retail data. In the FlexiMart system, order data naturally contains nested information such as multiple products per order. Representing this structure in a relational database requires multiple tables and complex joins, which increase query complexity and reduce read performance.

Additionally, relational schemas are rigid and require predefined structures. Any change in business requirements, such as adding new attributes to orders or products, often requires schema migrations that can be time-consuming and risky. Relational databases also scale vertically by default, making them less suitable for high-volume read-heavy workloads common in analytics and reporting scenarios.

These limitations make relational databases less flexible for handling semi-structured and hierarchical data generated by modern retail systems like FlexiMart.

### B. Why NoSQL (MongoDB) is Suitable for FlexiMart

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that provides flexibility, scalability, and efficient data access for semi-structured data. In the FlexiMart use case, orders naturally contain nested order items, which can be stored as embedded documents within a single MongoDB document. This eliminates the need for complex joins and allows complete order details to be retrieved in a single query.

MongoDB’s flexible schema enables rapid evolution of the data model without requiring costly migrations. New attributes can be added to documents as business requirements change. Additionally, MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, making it suitable for handling growing data volumes and high read workloads.

These characteristics make MongoDB an ideal choice for managing retail order data, product catalogs, and customer activity in FlexiMart.

### C. Trade-offs of Using NoSQL Databases

While NoSQL databases offer flexibility and scalability, they also introduce certain trade-offs. NoSQL systems generally provide weaker transactional guarantees compared to relational databases, which can be a concern for financial consistency. Data duplication is more common in NoSQL designs, increasing storage usage and requiring careful handling during updates.

Furthermore, complex analytical queries are often better supported in relational or data warehouse systems. As a result, NoSQL databases are best used alongside relational databases rather than as a complete replacement. In FlexiMart, MongoDB complements the relational database by efficiently handling semi-structured data while core transactional integrity remains in MySQL.
